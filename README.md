# Basketball Hack Day @ BITCON 

### A one-day basketball coding competition where sports and tech collide!

**Basketball Hack Day @ BITCON** is a one-day coding competition, also known as a hackathon or code fest, where basketball fans and tech enthusiasts come together and create simple basketball related apps, tools,  sites, data visualizations, devices, and prototypes. The goal of the day is to bring creative tech minds into one room, and see what they can produce within a limited time.
